# Adult_Classification
MLCC - First Bangkit Data Science Project 2020


There are two jupyter notebook files in this repository:

1. Bangkit_adult_sigmoid_freq_v2.ipynb is jupyter notebook files that is used as final python script. The categorical encoding is performed with pandas dataframe and the sequential keras model is equipped with Relu activation at dense layer and some regularization methods.
2. Bangkit_rawadult_sigmoid_freq_v2.ipynb contains the same script but using feature column encoding methods and a simple linear sequential model without regularization.
